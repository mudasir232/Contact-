Contact Management System
A simple CRUD app for managing contacts using ASP.NET Core (API) + Angular (Frontend)

üìù Project Overview
This project allows you to add, view, and delete contacts through a user-friendly Angular interface or directly via API endpoints. The backend uses an in-memory database, so contacts are not persisted between server restarts (you‚Äôll need to re-add them each time the app runs).

Features
Add Contacts: Submit a form with name, email, and phone number.

View Contacts: See a list of all saved contacts.

Delete Contacts: Remove existing contacts with a single click.

API Integration: Interact directly with the backend using RESTful endpoints.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Backend: ASP.NET Core (REST API)

Frontend: Angular (TypeScript)

Database: In-memory storage (temporary data)
